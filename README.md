# Linkedin-Advanced-Microsoft-Power-BI

This Project is based on Linkedin learning's course on Advanced Microsoft Power BI.

Many basic and advanced Power BI topics were covered during the project, including how to work with calculations, leverage the DAX language, develop advanced queries, and use the M language to improve the querying process. I also used X-factor functions, conditional statements, filter results, construct charts, and more to import data from diverse sources, build complicated formulas, manage fields and columns in tables, use X-factor functions, conditional statements, and more.
