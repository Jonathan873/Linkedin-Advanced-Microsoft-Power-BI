# Linkedin-Advanced-Microsoft-Power-BI

This Project is based on Linkedin learning's course on Advanced Microsoft Power BI.

During the course of the project, many basic and advanced topics of Power BI were covered like how to work with calculations, leverage the DAX language, create advanced queries, and use the M language to improve the querying process. I also imported data from various sources, composed advanced formulas, managed the fields and columns in tables, used X-factor functions, conditional statements, filter results, design charts, and more.
